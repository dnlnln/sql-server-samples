#
# Powershell script for loading telemetry data from elastic pools and elastic database 
# into a telemetry database. To be used in conjunction with PoolTelemetry.ps1, which 
# should be installed in the same directory.
#
# This script should be customized as required (see <<<) to select one or more source 
# servers, and will then spawn a telemetry gathering job for each server based on 
# Load-PoolTelemetryForServer in PoolTelemetry.ps1, which loads telemetry for all 
# pools and elastic databases on the server.  Each spawned job will run for an 
# extended period in the background, waking up periodically to load more telemetry.  
# The interval between telemetry gathering and the total duration can be controlled 
# by parameters set in this script.
#   
# Pool telemetry is loaded from the server master database, database telemetry is 
# optionally loaded from each elastic database. This script assumes a common 
# user name and password is used to connect to all source servers and databases.
